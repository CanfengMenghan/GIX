Will @ 10:39:47

Translation (简体中文): 我将做的是当我们稍后有问题答案会话。我会再次打开麦克风, 你可以问。

Recognition (英语): (What I'll do is when we have question answer session later. I'll open the mic up again, and you can ask.)



Will @ 10:39:53

Translation (简体中文): 三或手机, 请只是问问题不要做傻事。

Recognition (英语): (Three or phones please just ask questions don't do silly things.)



Will @ 10:40:09

Translation (简体中文): 好。所以我们的微软翻译实际上是在很多这样的上下文中使用的, 我得到每当我给讲座我出去做讲座, 它是非常像这样, 你可以看到的例子。这。

Recognition (英语): (Okay. So we've the Microsoft translator is actually been used in a lot of context like this, I get whenever I give lectures I go out and give lectures and it's very much like this and you can see examples of. This.)



Will @ 10:40:15

Translation (简体中文): 从学校来的因此, 全国各地都有学校在高中使用, 也在大学一级使用。

Recognition (英语): (From school. So there's schools across the country that are using this both in high schools, but also at the university level.)



Will @ 10:40:22

Translation (简体中文): 所以你会在这些图片中看到一堆不同的图片, 从人们在教室里使用这种技术的实际教室。

Recognition (英语): (And so you see a bunch of different pictures in these from actual classrooms where people are using this technology in the classroom.)



Will @ 10:40:31

Translation (简体中文): 它不仅被用于多种语言。所以也许你有会说普通话的学生和会说英语的教授。

Recognition (英语): (It's being used not just for multiple languages. So maybe you have students who speak Mandarin and the professor speaking in English.)



Will @ 10:40:36

Translation (简体中文): 这就是我们在这里的情况, 但它也被用于聋哑人的背景下。

Recognition (英语): (That the scenario we have here, but it's also used in the context of people who are deaf.)



Will @ 10:40:41

Translation (简体中文): 或者听力不好, 我会解释其中的一些存在。因此, 这里有一些例子。

Recognition (英语): (Or hard of hearing and I'll explain some of these is there. So there are some examples of that here where.)



Will @ 10:40:48

Translation (简体中文): 学生们其实是聋子, 他们正在拿到正在说什么的成绩单, 所以他们知道在说什么。

Recognition (英语): (The students are actually deaf who are getting transcripts of what's being said, so they know what's being said.)



Will @ 10:40:56

Translation (简体中文): 所以, 让我们来谈谈语音翻译。因此, 这方面的基础基本上是涉及多种技术。

Recognition (英语): (So let's talk a little bit about speech translation. So the underpinnings of this is basically multiple technologies are involved.)



Will @ 10:41:04

Translation (简体中文): 微软在机器翻译方面的工作已经很长时间了。这其实是最早在这个领域工作的公司之一。

Recognition (英语): (Microsoft is been working on machine translation for very long time. It's actually one of the first companies to work in this space.)



Will @ 10:41:14

Translation (简体中文): 我们于1991年开始从事自然语言处理工作, 这是微软1995年在该公司进行机器翻译的第一个研究项目。

Recognition (英语): (We started working on natural language processing in 1991 the first research projects in machine translation at microsoft where in 1995.)



Will @ 10:41:22

Translation (简体中文): 这里没有显示, 但后来我们开始为自己的产品进行机器翻译。所以翻译。

Recognition (英语): (It's not shown here, but then we started working on machine translation for our own product. So translating.)



Will @ 10:41:31

Translation (简体中文): 知识库和文档之类的东西, 供我们自己的内部使用, 然后从2007年开始。

Recognition (英语): (Knowledge bases and documents and stuff like that for our own internal use and then starting in 2007.)



Will @ 10:41:40

Translation (简体中文): 我们实际上是作为公共产品发布的。所以这只是文本翻译。这样我就可以用普通话打一些东西了。让我们说或者用中文说吧。

Recognition (英语): (We actually released it as a public product. So that was just text translation. So I could type something in Mandarin. Let's say or in Chinese.)



Will @ 10:41:47

Translation (简体中文): 并有它翻译或有一些德语和翻译成俄语, 他会做文字翻译, 但随着时间的推移, 我们开始。

Recognition (英语): (And have it translate or have something in German and translate to Russian he would do text translation but over time we started.)



Will @ 10:41:57

Translation (简体中文): 做语音翻译。因此, 您所看到的是语音识别和机器翻译技术组合的最终结果。

Recognition (英语): (Doing speech translation. So what you're seeing is the end result of both speech recognition and machine translation a combination of technologies.)



Will @ 10:42:02

Translation (简体中文): 而人们在这项技术上工作了很长时间, 但很长时间都不是很好。

Recognition (英语): (And people have worked on this technology for a long time, but it wasn't very good for very long time.)



Will @ 10:42:04

Translation (简体中文): 只是。

Recognition (英语): (Just.)



Will @ 10:42:08

Translation (简体中文): 在过去几年里, 它变得可行。

Recognition (英语): (In the past few years it became viable.)



Will @ 10:42:14

Translation (简体中文): 所以我们有一大堆因素的结合。我不会在这里走过这一切。

Recognition (英语): (And so we have kind of a combination of a whole bunch of factors. I'm not going to walk through all of this here.)



Will @ 10:42:22

Translation (简体中文): 顺便说一下, 我将和这里的人分享甲板。所以, 如果你想访问这个甲板上的内容, 那里有引用。所以有论文说我指的是第二。

Recognition (英语): (By the way, I'll share the deck with the people here. So if you want access to the content in this deck, there's references there. So there papers that I point two.)



Will @ 10:42:27

Translation (简体中文): 在这里, 你可以回去阅读这些文件, 如果你想要一些非常技术性的, 但你们。

Recognition (英语): (Here you can go back and read these papers if you want some very technical but you guys.)



Will @ 10:42:36

Translation (简体中文): 技术上, 我想你可以读懂其中的一些, 在这一点上, 有一种因素交织在一起, 使这成为可能。

Recognition (英语): (Technical, I think you can read some of these and there's kind of a confluence of factors that have made this possible at this point.)



Will @ 10:42:42

Translation (简体中文): 语音识别方面的第一大改进。在过去的十年里, 这种情况又发生了。

Recognition (英语): (Number one big improvements in speech recognition. That's happened in the past decade more in the past couple of years.)



Will @ 10:42:49

Translation (简体中文): 你可以看到相当不错的结果。这是一台正在抄录我的机器。这不是根据我的声音定制的。

Recognition (英语): (And you can see the results pretty good. This is a machine that's transcribing me. This is not customized to my voice.)



Will @ 10:42:58

Translation (简体中文): 这只是通用模型。这被用来抄写我, 真的相当不错。它的错误率在 1 0% 左右。

Recognition (英语): (This is just the generic model. That's being used to transcribe me and it's really quite good. It has an error rate of around 10 percent.)



Will @ 10:43:07

Translation (简体中文): 这相当不错, 人类最好的表现是在这个范围内的四比6%。这是人类能做到的最好的。

Recognition (英语): (That's pretty good the best human performance is four or 6 percent in that range. That's the best that human can do this.)



Will @ 10:43:14

Translation (简体中文): 所以我们至少在人类能力的范围内。所以我们在达到人类水平做了很多工作。

Recognition (英语): (So we're within range of human competence at least best human competence. So we've done a lot of work on human parity.)



Will @ 10:43:23

Translation (简体中文): 这意味着我们如何实现与人们在同一任务中所做的类似的质量结果。所以你可以看到下面。

Recognition (英语): (Meaning how we can achieve quality results that are similar to what people do in the same task. So you can see there under.)



Will @ 10:43:33

Translation (简体中文): 对。这里的这些论文来自微软研究, 在这里谈论语音识别的达到人类水平。我们也在努力。

Recognition (英语): (Right. Here these papers here from Microsoft Research talk about human parity for speech recognition. We're also working on.)



Will @ 10:43:38

Translation (简体中文): 达到人类水平机器翻译。这些都是最近的论文。因此, 这些甚至还没有在产品中。

Recognition (英语): (Human parity for machine translation. And these are very recent papers. So these are not even in product yet.)



Will @ 10:43:47

Translation (简体中文): 在审查翻译的人无法判断是机器还是人翻译成内容的地方。

Recognition (英语): (Where people who were reviewing the translations couldn't tell whether it was a machine or a person that it translated to content.)



Will @ 10:43:55

Translation (简体中文): 因此, 达到这样的能力水平其实是相当了不起的。而这一切都发生在短短几年内, 为什么。

Recognition (英语): (So to achieve that level of competence is actually pretty remarkable. And this is all happened within just a span of a few years why.)



Will @ 10:44:04

Translation (简体中文): 部分原因是有很多数据, 我们有大量的数据, 但也有底层的培训基础设施是基础技术。

Recognition (英语): (Partly because there's a lot of data we have a huge amount of data, but also the underlying training infrastructure an underlying technology.)



Will @ 10:44:13

Translation (简体中文): 神经网络。真的有可能以这种质量做如此大规模的语音识别。还有机器翻译。

Recognition (英语): (Neural networks. Really had made it possible to do speech recognition at this scale at this quality. And also machine translation.)



Will @ 10:44:22

Translation (简体中文): 不, 当我们第一次发布第一个产品, 这是四年前与 skype 翻译, 你可以看到一个例子, 有人在电话里说话。所以你可以。

Recognition (英语): (No, when we first released the first product this was four years ago with Skype Translator and you can see an example of someone talking on the phone. So you can.)



Will @ 10:44:30

Translation (简体中文): 你可以使用 skype, 你可以打电话给别人在另一个地方打开翻译, 它会为你翻译, 因为你说话。

Recognition (英语): (You can use skype you can call someone in another place turn on translation, and it will translate for you as you're talking.)



Will @ 10:44:38

Translation (简体中文): 所以, 如果我给北京的人打电话说, 我不会说普通话, 我可以和你说话吗, 我真的做到了。我给中国各地的人打了电话。

Recognition (英语): (So if I call someone in Beijing and say, I don't speak any Mandarin can I talk to you and I've actually done this. I've called people in various parts of China.)



Will @ 10:44:43

Translation (简体中文): 在我说英语的地方, 他们说的是普通话, 我们可以互相交谈。

Recognition (英语): (Where I'm speaking in English they speak in Mandarin and we can have a conversation with one another.)



Will @ 10:44:52

Translation (简体中文): 基础技术。都在 api 里。因此, 它由您可以通过此 api 实际开发的 api 控制。它是整数。

Recognition (英语): (The underlying technology. It's all in API. So it's controlled by an API you can actually develop over this API. It's integer.)



Will @ 10:45:01

Translation (简体中文): 服务和所有这些都是在相同 api 上构建的不同工具, 也有第三方工具开发人员在使用此 api。

Recognition (英语): (Service and all of these are different tools that are built on that same API and there are third party tools developers working on this API as well.)



Will @ 10:45:13

Translation (简体中文): 所以这里的想法是演讲翻译背后的想法, 你有一个说一种语言的人, 他们和别人说的是另一种语言。

Recognition (英语): (So the idea here is the idea behind speech translation you have someone who speaks one language they talk to someone else's speaks a different language.)



Will @ 10:45:15

Translation (简体中文): 语言二种语言一。

Recognition (英语): (Language two language one.)



Will @ 10:45:21

Translation (简体中文): 我们对着这样的麦克风说话, 在耳机下说话, 或者打电话, 或者你有什么。

Recognition (英语): (We speak into a microphone like this or under headset or and or phone or what have you.)



Will @ 10:45:27

Translation (简体中文): 它识别讲话。所以这就是语音识别部分, 它实际上是什么转录它是时间。

Recognition (英语): (It recognizes the speech. So this is the speech recognition part which actually transcribing what it is the time.)



Will @ 10:45:28

Translation (简体中文): 说。

Recognition (英语): (Saying.)



Will @ 10:45:34

Translation (简体中文): 然后我们做翻译。所以我们把文字, 这是在这里生成的, 然后我们翻译。

Recognition (英语): (Then we do the translation. So we take the text, that's being generated here and then we translate that.)



Will @ 10:45:42

Translation (简体中文): 进入其他语言, 然后我们产生音频, 如果我们想要的音频。所以这个泡沫并不是必不可少的。

Recognition (英语): (Into the other language and then we produce audio if we want the audio. So this bubble isn't essential.)



Will @ 10:45:48

Translation (简体中文): 有这样的经历很有趣, 因为你可以用自己的语言倾听。然后我们要做相反和相反的方向。

Recognition (英语): (It's fun to have that cause you can listen in your own language. And then we want to do the reverse and the other direction.)



Will @ 10:45:54

Translation (简体中文): 这比我想谈的是一些复杂的事情要复杂得多。

Recognition (英语): (It's a lot more complicated than that I'd like to talk about a little bit about some of the complications of this.)



Will @ 10:46:06

Translation (简体中文): 除了把这两个组件放在一起, 还有更多的东西。你不可能只是在真正好的机器翻译中拥有真正好的语音识别, 期望能奏效, 原因是我们说话不流利。

Recognition (英语): (There's more to it than just putting these two components together. You can't just have really good speech recognition in really good machine translation expected to work and the reason why is that we don't talk fluently.)



Will @ 10:46:14

Translation (简体中文): 每个人都说他们停顿了一下这种东西, 这不能很好地翻译。

Recognition (英语): (Everyone talks they pause well this kind of stuff, and that doesn't translate well.)



Will @ 10:46:24

Translation (简体中文): 因此, 我们构建了一个组件, 它在不流利处理中执行所有此文本规范化, 使我们能够拥有这些文本。

Recognition (英语): (So we have a component that we built that does all of this text normalization in disfluency processing to make it possible for us to have.)



Will @ 10:46:33

Translation (简体中文): 像这样的对话, 否则, 它不会工作在所有, 因为如果我们转录, 如果我们翻译的内容是。

Recognition (英语): (Conversations like this, otherwise, it wouldn't work at all because if we transcribed the if we translate the content that is been.)



Will @ 10:46:41

Translation (简体中文): 从我们所有的不和谐中描述出来, 它在另一种语言中完全无法使用, 因为我们不知道这个人在说什么。

Recognition (英语): (Transcribed from all of our disfluencies, it's completely unusable in the other language because we won't know what this person is saying.)



Will @ 10:46:50

Translation (简体中文): 因此, 我们有一个组件称为 truetext, 我们开发的, 做这种中介之间的语音识别和机器翻译。

Recognition (英语): (So we have this component called truetext that we developed that does this mediation between speech recognition and machine translation.)



Will @ 10:46:55

Translation (简体中文): 所以这里的想法是, 人们不会像他们写的那样说话。

Recognition (英语): (So the idea here is that people don't talk the way they write.)



Will @ 10:47:00

Translation (简体中文): 当我们建立翻译系统。我们按照人们正确的方式建造了它们。

Recognition (英语): (When we built translation systems. We built them on the way people right.)



Will @ 10:47:09

Translation (简体中文): 我们在这些文本文档上构建机器翻译的文本文档, 人们不会以他们说话的方式进行非常不同的操作。

Recognition (英语): (We take text documents we build machine translation over those text documents people don't talk that way they talk very differently.)



Will @ 10:47:19

Translation (简体中文): 而人们是惊人的不流利, 如果你从我的文字记录, 它不是做不流利的处理, 现在它是, 但如果你采取这些成绩单。

Recognition (英语): (And people are amazingly disfluent if you take the transcripts from me where it's not doing disfluency processing right now it is, but if you were to take these transcripts.)



Will @ 10:47:26

Translation (简体中文): 然后试着读它们, 你会认为我疯了, 就这样, 这完全是垃圾。我不明白他的意思

Recognition (英语): (And then try to read them, you'll think I'm insane just look at it like, this is complete garbage. I don't understand him.)



Will @ 10:47:33

Translation (简体中文): 但我们的头脑真的很擅长过滤掉所有的东西。所以我们想做的是建立一个赞美, 做我们的思想？

Recognition (英语): (But our minds are really good at filtering out all of that stuff. So we wanted to do is build a compliment that does what our minds?)



Will @ 10:47:36

Translation (简体中文): 我们如何过滤掉所有的噪音。

Recognition (英语): (Do how do we filter out all of that noise.)



Will @ 10:47:42

Translation (简体中文): 在, 那么人们也不会用标点符号说话。所以我不同意说, 好吧, 很好。

Recognition (英语): (In, then people don't talk with punctuation either. So I don't go along and say, well, it's very nice.)



Will @ 10:47:52

Translation (简体中文): 为了满足你的经期。你好吗？今天的问号没有人这样说话。好。因此, 我们必须插入这些东西。

Recognition (英语): (To meet you period. How are you? Today question mark nobody talks that way. Okay. So we have to insert those things.)



Will @ 10:47:56

Translation (简体中文): 进入文本。我们必须对此作出猜测。而我们在头脑中有点做到了这一点。

Recognition (英语): (Into the text. We have to make guesses about that. And we kind of do that in our minds.)



Will @ 10:48:02

Translation (简体中文): 你也注意到了它是在这样做的时候, 我说的是标点符号。

Recognition (英语): (Also you notice. It's doing that while I'm talking of puts in punctuation.)



Will @ 10:48:06

Translation (简体中文): 它是如何做到这一点？

Recognition (英语): (How is it doing that?)



Will @ 10:48:15

Translation (简体中文): 看, 它知道有一个问题。现在在中文里, 这更容易, 你能不能和妈妈结束, 然后你就有了一个问题。

Recognition (英语): (See it knew there was a question. Now in Chinese that's easier could you just end it with mom and then you've got a question.)



Will @ 10:48:24

Will @ 11:31:32

Translation (简体中文): 它会问你是否想说成绩单, 然后你就能保存了。

Recognition (英语): (It will ask you if you want to say the transcripts and then you'll be able to save it.)



Will @ 11:31:40

Translation (简体中文): 如果你收到的是中文的, 你可以说是双语成绩单, 你会得到英语和汉语。

Recognition (英语): (And if you're receiving it in a in Chinese you can say the bilingual transcripts, you'll get english and Chinese.)



Will @ 11:31:51

Translation (简体中文): 你能救他说的话吗？

Recognition (英语): (Can you save what he said is it?)



Will @ 11:32:04

Translation (简体中文): 好。这是个有趣的问题。所以文字记录本身就会成为有用的模型, 只要它们是好的成绩单, 所以问题是这是一台机器。

Recognition (英语): (Okay. That's an interesting question. So the transcripts themselves become useful models as long as they're good transcripts, so the problem is that this is a machine.)



Will @ 11:32:10

Translation (简体中文): 在实际训练机器之前, 您可能希望纠正这些错误, 因为否则您将对内容进行迭代。

Recognition (英语): (You probably want to correct the errors before you actually train a machine on it because otherwise you're iterating on content.)



Will @ 11:32:19

Translation (简体中文): 由同一设备生成。这不是个好主意。但你能做的是, 如果你有纠正的成绩单。您可以保存这些文件并在模型中使用这些文件。

Recognition (英语): (Generated by the same device. That's not a good idea. But what you can do is if you have corrected transcripts. You can save those and use those in a model.)

Recognition (英语): (Sure. It's really there's code you would use code to access the API but you're basically building an instance of the speech recognition.)



Will @ 11:33:40

Translation (简体中文): 这是自定义的任何上下文, 您想要的自定义实例, 没有 api 调用它。您可以创建两个自定义实例。

Recognition (英语): (That's customized whatever context you want that customized instance that hasn't API call it. You can make two that customize instance.)



Will @ 11:33:49

Translation (简体中文): 所以我有一个 api 调用来生成这个文本, 你会有一个 api 调用, 你会发送音频二你的模型。

Recognition (英语): (So I'm there's an API called to generate this text, you would have an API call to you would send audio two your model.)



Will @ 11:33:53

Translation (简体中文): 它将通过 api 调用返回文本给您。

Recognition (英语): (And it would return text back to you through the API call.)

Recognition (英语): (That's a real problem for speech recognition, and it's something I would say that we don't have solved and most people don't have solved, but what.)



Will @ 11:34:32

Translation (简体中文): 解决这个问题的那种蛮力的方法, 就是把这个词汇添加到英语模型中。所以, 如果有中国的术语, 比如中国的城市名称之类的东西。我只是把它们放在模型里。

Recognition (英语): (The kind of the brute force way to solve this is just add that vocabulary into the English model. So if there are Chinese terms like Chinese city names and stuff like that. I just put them in the model.)



Will @ 11:34:34

Translation (简体中文): 我把它们加入进来。

Recognition (英语): (I add them in.)



Will @ 11:34:40

Translation (简体中文): 更好的方法是有一个认识到话语的那部分的模型。

Recognition (英语): (A better way would be have a model that recognizes the part of the utterance that is.)



Will @ 11:34:49

Translation (简体中文): 在英语和话语的部分。那是用普通话说的, 然后再换, 所以当你先说一种语言的时候, 它经常会排队告诉你。

Recognition (英语): (In English and the part of the utterance. That's in Mandarin and then switch, so it would often line tell when you're speaking one language first.)



Will @ 11:34:57

Translation (简体中文): 另一个是人们换这样的语言是很自然的。对于语音识别系统来说, 这是很不自然的。

Recognition (英语): (The other it's very natural for people to switch languages like that. It's very unnatural for a speech recognition system.)



Will @ 11:35:03

Translation (简体中文): 用目前的技术。但这种情况最终改变了, 会发生的情况是, 两种模式都会同时活跃。

Recognition (英语): (With current technology. But that's changing ultimately what will happen is both models will be active in the same time.)
